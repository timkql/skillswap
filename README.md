## üöÄ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/timkql/skillswap.git
cd skillswap
```

### 2. Quick Setup
We provide a convenient script to set up and update dependencies:

```bash
# Make the script executable (first time only)
chmod +x skillswap

# Initial setup
./skillswap setup

# Update dependencies
./skillswap update

# Start React App and FastAPI Server
./skillswap start
```

The script provides the following commands:
- `setup`: Initial project setup (installs all dependencies)
- `update`: Update all dependencies
- `start`: Start both frontend and backend

The `start` command will:
- Launch the FastAPI server on http://localhost:8000
- Launch the React development server on http://localhost:3000
- Handle graceful shutdown of both servers when you press Ctrl+C

## üì± User Journey

1. **Sign Up/Login**: Create an account or log in using email/password
2. **Complete Profile**: Select skills to teach and/or learn
3. **Browse Matches**: View users who match your skill requirements
4. **Search**: Find specific teachers by skill
5. **Request Sessions**: Schedule learning sessions with matched users via sending a request
6. **Attend Sessions**: When the teacher accepts your request, a calendar invite with a meets link will be available

## Design Considerations
- Firebase may not be the most ideal storage in the long run, but it was the quickest to setup
- Features were prioritzed based on value provided to users. So I wanted to make sure users could look for and request for lessons from appropriate teachers.

## Future Features
- Learning credits
    - Every week given 2 credits
    - 1 hour lesson costs 1 credit
    - Teaching 1 hour earns you 1 credit
    - Users can buy more credits if they wish
- Community guidelines
- Reporting on teacher/learner no-shows/inappropriate behavior
- Map/Stats on what learning/teaching activity around your area
- Consistency and progress badges

## Future Backend Features:
- Delete availability data from the past
- Setup github secrets for env variables

## Bugs to fix
- Generated Meets link might not work
- User is routed to profile setup screen before dashboard
